## Install

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Run

Run the app with `npm start`.

## Building Squelch

Run the command `npm run build` to build a packaged version of Squelch for your current platform and architecture. If you would like to build for a specific platform, run `npm run build -- --platform win32,darwin,linux --arch ia32,x64`, but with your choices of platforms and architectures. A handy shortcut to build all platforms and architectures is `npm run build:all`.
